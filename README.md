# Solar Resource Assessment in Python

This is the repository for the guide Solar Resource Assessment in Python, which can be found on [AssessingSolar.org](https://assessingsolar.org/). The guide presents best practices related to solar resource assessment, and is a collaborative effort within the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme Task 16 ([IEA PVPS Task 16](https://iea-pvps.org/research-tasks/solar-resource-for-high-penetration-and-large-scale-applications/contacts_t16/)). The guide covers a wide range of topics including solar radiation modeling, data quality assessment, and how to obtain and manipulate solar data. The aim is to disseminate best practices and further the adoption of state-of-the-art methods.
